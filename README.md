# image2pdf

A Python-based tool for compressing any single image to a single pdf

You can specify a target filesize (less than the size of the image), and the tool will brute-force recursive generations to achieve the target filesize.

As a bonus, you will have all the files from all the iterations (sorted according to filesize), and you can make an informed decision on which ones to delete and which one to keep.

The lower the filesize, the worse the quality gets.
