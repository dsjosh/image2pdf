# image2pdf

A Python-based tool for compressing any single image to a single pdf

You can specify a target filesize (less than the size of the image), and the tool will brute-force recursive generations to achieve the target filesize.

As a bonus, you will have all the files from all the iterations, and you can make an informed decision on which ones to delete and which one to keep.
